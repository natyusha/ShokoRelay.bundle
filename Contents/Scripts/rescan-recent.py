Description:
  - This is mostly used for quickly adding currently airing series to Plex that were unrecognized when initially imported into Shoko.
  - Once the files are recognized running this script will trigger a rescan in Plex for any series that they are attached to.
Author:
  - natyusha
Requirements:
  - Python 3.7+, Python-PlexAPI (pip install plexapi), Requests Library (pip install requests), Plex, Shoko Server
Preferences:
  - Before doing anything with this script you must enter your Shoko Server credentials into config.py.
  - The Path Remapping section can be configured when running the scripts from a location where the paths differ from Shoko's.
Usage:
  - Run in a terminal (rescan-recent.py) to trigger a Plex rescan of the 5 most recently added series in Shoko.
  - Change the number of recently added series (from 1-99) to rescan with an argument when 5 isn't enough:
      - (rescan-recent.py 20) would rescan the 20 most recently added series
  - Append the argument "import" (rescan-recent.py import) if you want to force Shoko to import unrecognized files.
  - Append the argument "remove" (rescan-recent.py remove) if you want to force Shoko to remove missing files incl. MyList.
